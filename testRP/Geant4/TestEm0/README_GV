TestEm0 is a standard Geant4 test application to compute/obtain(from tables) integrated
EM related quantities like (restricted)macroscopic cross section, (restricted)stopping
power, etc. for a given particle, (material-cut)material, kinetic energy based on the
selected physics list. The Geant4 application was taken from:
     Geant4-10.3 examples/extended/electromagnetic/TestEm0
and used without major modifications (an EM physics constructor PhysListGVStandard
special for GeantV has been added).
