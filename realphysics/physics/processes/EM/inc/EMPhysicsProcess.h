 * @brief   Base class to provide interface for all ordinary electromagnetic physics processes.

 * @author  M Novak, A Ribon
 * @date    august 2016
 *
 * The interface provides common implementations for some methods: to initialize the EMPhysicsProcess, compute
 * macroscopic cross section, dE/dx (for kEnergyLoss processes) and to add EMModel-s. Each EMPhysicsProcess has an
 * EMModelManager member. EMModels can be added and accessed through this EMModelManager member of the EMPhysicsProcess.
 * The EMModelManager object owns all the models that have been added to the EMPhysicsProcess.
 *
 * TODO: implement method for AlongStepLimit, AlongStepDoIt, (post step limit is handled by the PhysicsManagerPerParticle)
 * PostStepDoIt.

   * This method must be called for each electromagnetic physics processes: those derived processes that has their own
   * Initialize() method implementation needs to call this base class Initialize() method explicitely!
   *
   * Fisrt the PhysicsProcess base class Initialize method will be called that: it will be checked there if the process
   * is assigned only to particles that the process is allowed to. Then the Initialize method of the EMModelManager
   * member of this EMPhysicsProcess will be called: (1) will set for each EMModel-s that have been added to the
   * EMPhysicsProcess the list of active regions: (a) first the default active regions which are determined by the
   * active regions of the EMPhysicsProcess; (b) on the top of this, the user requested inactive regions are considered
   * in case of each individual EMModel-s; (2) the EMModelManager will prepare the list of active EMModel-s per region
   * collections. (3) After each EMModel-s active regions list is set, the EMModelManager will initilise all EMModel-s:
   * each EMModel-s will be initilized only for reagions where they are active.
   * After the initialization of the EMModelManager member, it is checked if this EMPhysicsProcess is a kEnergyLoss
   * process and if yes then it will be registered in the ELossTableRegister singletone for particles this kEnergyLoss
   * EMPhysicsProcess is assigned to. This information will be used later to build all energy loss related tables like
   * dEdx or range table by the ELossTable objects that are created and handled by the ELossTableManager singletone.
